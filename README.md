## Legacy project

This is an inherited project from the group Wild Coders. The original repository can be found at: https://github.com/Adalab/easley-s2-wildcoders.

We created a new repository to refactor the code using the React library:

## Original project: Awesome Profile Cards

For this project, we made an interactive web application to create personalized business cards. Through the app, users can introduce their professional information and preview the card before downloading it.

The application works as follows:

- It allows users to choose the style for the card in terms of colour and typography.

- When information is entered in the form, it is automatically displayed on the screen for the user to have a preview of the card before downloading it.

- When the card is generated, users can share it through Twitter.
