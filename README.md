##Original Project: Awesome Profile Cards

For this project we made a web application that allows users to create a personalized business card. Through the app we can introduce our professional information and dowmload a (design view with this information) professiona
It will be an interactive web application created by the user and that he can use to create his own professional business cards.

The application works by following these steps:

- Allow the user to choose the style of the card, choosing the color palette and typography.

- Allow the user, when entering information in a form, that this text is automatically displayed in a box similar to a business card, which will be the sample of the final result.

- Allow the user to share his business card through Twitter.
